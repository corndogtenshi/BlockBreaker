# BlockBreaker
## About:
Block Breaker is a basic breakout clone created in Unity 3D. I originally created it by following along with a now deprecated version of Udemy's [Complete C# Unity Game Developer 2D](https://www.udemy.com/course/unitycourse/) course.

I have tweaked the physics, created my own levels, and created my own graphics to add on to the initial project. 

## How to play:
You can use the mouse to move the paddle around and hit the ball. 

Press the left mouse button to release the ball.

Press alt+f4 to quit.
